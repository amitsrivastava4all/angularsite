He has done so coming from the cricketing backwaters, the mining state of Jharkhand, and through a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scales the highs and lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India have won the top prize in all formats: the No.1 Test ranking for 18 months starting December 2009, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the World Twenty20 on his captaincy debut in 2007. \n\n","bowlingStyle":"Right-arm medium","battingStyle":"Right-hand bat","playingRole":"Wicketkeeper batsman","majorTeams":"India,Asia XI,Bihar,Chennai Super Kings,Jharkhand,Rising Pune Supergiants","currentAge":"35 years 220 days","born":"July 7, 1981, Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand)","fullName":"Mahendra Singh Dhoni","name":"MS Dhoni","data":{"batting":{"twenty20":{"50":"19","100":"0","St":"61","Ct":"123","6s":"210","4s":"357","SR":"135.85","BF":"3718","Ave":"37.69","HS":"73*","Runs":"5051","NO":"88","Inns":"222","Mat":"248"},"listA":{"50":"74","100":"16","St":"112","Ct":"343","6s":"","4s":"","SR":"","BF":"","Ave":"50.32","HS":"183*","Runs":"11525","NO":"80","Inns":"309","Mat":"351"},"firstClass":{"50":"47","100":"9","St":"57","Ct":"364","6s":"","4s":"","SR":"","BF":"","Ave":"36.84","HS":"224","Runs":"7038","NO":"19","Inns":"210","Mat":"131"},"T20Is":{"50":"1","100":"0","St":"23","Ct":"42","6s":"36","4s":"83","SR":"123.49","BF":"979","Ave":"36.63","HS":"56","Runs":"1209","NO":"33","Inns":"66","Mat":"76"},"ODIs":{"50":"61","100":"10","St":"94","Ct":"269","6s":"204","4s":"717","SR":"88.98","BF":"10423","Ave":"50.96","HS":"183*","Runs":"9275","NO":"67","Inns":"249","Mat":"286"},"tests":{"50":"33","100":"6","St":"38","Ct":"256","6s":"78","4s":"544","SR":"59.11","BF":"8249","Ave":"38.09","HS":"224","Runs":"4876","NO":"16","Inns":"144","Mat":"90"}},"bowling":{"twenty20":{"10":"0","5w":"0","4w":"0","SR":"-","Econ":"12.50","Ave":"-","BBM":"-","BBI":"-","Wkts":"0","Runs":"25","Balls":"12","Inns":"1","Mat":"248"},"listA":{"10":"0","5w":"0","4w":"0","SR":"31.5","Econ":"5.04","Ave":"26.50","BBM":"1/14","BBI":"1/14","Wkts":"2","Runs":"53","Balls":"63","Inns":"","Mat":"351"},"firstClass":{"10":"0","5w":"0","4w":"0","SR":"-","Econ":"4.14","Ave":"-","BBM":"-","BBI":"-","Wkts":"0","Runs":"87","Balls":"126","Inns":"","Mat":"131"},"T20Is":{"10":"-","5w":"-","4w":"-","SR":"-","Econ":"-","Ave":"-","BBM":"-","BBI":"-","Wkts":"-","Runs":"-","Balls":"-","Inns":"-","Mat":"76"},"ODIs":{"10":"0","5w":"0","4w":"0","SR":"36.0","Econ":"5.16","Ave":"31.00","BBM":"1/14","BBI":"1/14","Wkts":"1","Runs":"31","Balls":"36","Inns":"2","Mat":"286"},"tests":{"10":"0","5w":"0","4w":"0","SR":"-","Econ":"4.18","Ave":"-","BBM":"-","BBI":"-","Wkts":"0","Runs":"67","Balls":"96","Inns":"7","Mat":"90"}}}}
